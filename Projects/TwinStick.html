      <h2>About TwinStick</h2>
      <p>TwinStick is a game where you play as a wizard. It was a small school project from my first year so there isn't really a goal. You can kill all the enemies and find all the unique wands that are spread over the map. All wands have their own attacks wich all cost mana (which you automaticly regain after not using mana for a while).<br></p>
      <h2>About Project</h2>
      <p>This was the first "big" school project at the end of my first year. The project was to make a TwinStick game and apparently we didn't bother to give it a name back then.. The project was about 8 weeks long for what I remember and our team consisted of 4 people (2 devs and 2 artists). As one of the devs I was monstly reponsible for the skill point system, wands and the lot of cheatcodes..</p>

      <h2>System</h2>
      <p>At the start of this project I had to think about how I was going to build the system. In the game players have to be able to pour different ingredients into the couldron, pour that into a flask and serve it to the client. I had to think of a way where I don't have to make all type of refrences to objects etc because that would get messy pretty fast. Eventually I desided to use enums. All ingredients and decorations have thair own ingredienttype wich will be put into the list in the couldron and flask. this way I don't have to make refrences and I can easily compare the flask list with the client's order list to look of the order is made correclty.<br></p>
      <h2>About Project</h2>
      <p>This is an older school project. The goal of the project was to build a simple 3D or 2D night racer. The project was about 6 weeks long and our team consisted of 4 people (2 devs and 2 artists). As a dev on this project, I was mainly responible for the steering mechanic and the power ups.</p>
